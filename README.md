# human-count-with-warning-system
Social distancing is very important in recent times due to covid-19 to solve the problem of crowd inside a closed area. hence to solve the problem I am using OpenCV library to use real time video in front of any closed area to check people entering and exiting and total people inside to know about the crowd inside closed area without entering. if the admin sets the limit of people entering the area, then if any other person enters after limit count it plays an output audio of warning person entering stating “stop! No entry”. The person who is entered once exits the count will be decremented and the total people inside will be changed, hence this real time count of person entering avoid crowd inside a close area such as counting the number of people in the stores/buildings/shopping malls etc., in real-time
